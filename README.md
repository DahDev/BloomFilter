# BloomFilter ![](https://travis-ci.org/DahDev/BloomFilter.svg?branch=master)

A Bloom Filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure. 
Presented solution is implemented in Java. It contains few methods for generating  independent hash functions:

- Double Hashing
- Triple Hashing 
- Enhanced Double Hashing

All the approaches are described in "Bloom Filters in Probabilistic Verification" by Peter C. Dillinger and Panagiotis Manolios. The paper is available [here](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/pete/pub/bloom-filters-verification.pdf).
